    "readme": "# hyper-dark-scrollbar\nDark scrollbar for [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper) - a plugin that stylizes the chunky Windows-ish scrollbar into a more sleek scrollbar.\n\nThe scrollbar is originally designed for [hyperterm-atom-dark](https://github.com/mdo/hyperterm-atom-dark), however, it also looks great on the standard theme, and should look fine on dark themes, as it utilises the theme background color. You're ~welcome~ encouraged to fork this project and modify it if you need to tinker with the colors to fit your theme better, or create a PR if I missed something that needs fixing.\n\n![screenshot](https://dev.moso.io/hyper/hyper-dark-scrollbar/screenshot.png)\n\n### Changelog\n**1.2.4**\n- Added hover-effect on the scrollbar\n\n**1.2.3**\n- Fixed scrollbar always visible ([4922649](https://github.com/moso/hyper-dark-scrollbar/commit/4922649b3505980524d1d856651f330a98ac02ac)) - thanks [@krve](https://github.com/krve)!\n\n**1.2.2**\n- Added attention note about the order of plugins for this plugin to work correctly\n- Removed docs about `hpm`\n\n**1.2.1**\n- Removed support for Hyper v1.4.8\n\n**1.2.0**\n- Fixed lacking support for xterm api in Hyper v2.x\n- Upgraded dependencies\n\n**1.1.0**\n- [henrikdahl](https://github.com/henrikdahl) magic - see [e6124e7](https://github.com/moso/hyper-dark-scrollbar/commit/e6124e7640291940acf46883d4022bef900ada60) for changes.\n\n**1.0.0**\n- Initial release.\n\n### Install\n\n**Hyper store**:\n```\nhyper i hyper-dark-scrollbar\n```\n\n**Manually**:\n\n1. Open Hyper's preferences with `Ctrl+,` (or manually at `~/.hyper.js`) with your editor.\n2. Update your list of plugins to include hyper-dark-scrollbar, like so:\n\n        plugins: [\n            'hyper-dark-scrollbar'\n        ],\n\n3. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart Hyper and voila!\n\n### Attention\n\nIf you have added a theme to Hyper, you will need to make sure `hyper-dark-scrollbar` is loaded **_after_** the theme; preferably last. Otherwise the utilisation of the `color`-package won't work, and you'll end up with whatever colors are defined in your `~/.hyper.js`.\n\nCheck your `~/.hyper.js` and make sure it look like this:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n    config: {\n\n        // ...\n\n        plugins: [\n            'theme',\n            // other plugins\n            'hyper-dark-scrollbar'\n        ],\n\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Related\n\n- [hyper-snazzy-scrollbar](https://github.com/Stanzilla/hyper-dark-scrollbar) - a fork for the [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) theme\n- [hyper-arc-dark-controls](https://github.com/moso/hyper-arc-dark-controls)\n- [hyper-pocillo-controls](https://github.com/moso/hyper-pocillo-controls)\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n",
