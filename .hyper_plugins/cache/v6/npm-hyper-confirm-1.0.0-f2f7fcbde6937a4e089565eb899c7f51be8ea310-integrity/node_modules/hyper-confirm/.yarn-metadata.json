This functionality, which is found in other terminal emulators like [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), provides a safety net against accidentally quitting Hyper (a common problem outlined in [Hyper Issue #399](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/399)).\n\n![](.github/demo.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via [hpm](https://github.com/zeit/hpm)\n\nTo install `hyper-confirm` via `hpm` (recommended), run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```\nhpm install hyper-confirm\n```\n\n### Manually\n\nIf you don't use `hpm`, add `hyper-confirm` to the `plugins` array in your Hyper config file (typically found at `~/.hyper.js`):\n\n```javascript\n  plugins: [\n    ...\n    'hyper-confirm'\n  ]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nAs of `hyper-confirm` v1.0, the quit confirmation dialog is enabled by default. To disable it, add `confirmQuit: false` to the `config` object in your Hyper config file (typically found at `~/.hyper.js`):\n\n```javascript\n  module.exports = {\n    config: {\n      ...\n      confirmQuit: false\n    },\n    ...\n  };\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n- [@albinekb](https://github.com/albinekb), who opened [this unmerged pull request](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/pull/403) that acted as the foundation for `hyper-confirm`\n\n\n## License\n\n`hyper-confirm` is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n",
