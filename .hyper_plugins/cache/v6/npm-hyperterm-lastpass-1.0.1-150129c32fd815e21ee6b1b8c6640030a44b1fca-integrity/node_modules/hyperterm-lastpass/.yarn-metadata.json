    "readme": "# HyperTerm Lastpass\n\n> Lastpass plugin for autofilling passwords in HyperTerm.\n\n## About\n\nI have admired [`hyperterm-1password`][1] because it seemed like such a cool\nidea, but I have always used Lastpass! This made me quite jealous, so I went\nahead and created [`lastpass-node`][2] because there were no Node.js clients yet\nfor Lastpass (_sigh_). Then I created this cool plugin! Finally, an easy way to\nfill in my passwords easily with HyperTerm ðŸŽ‰\n\nLastpass vaults are stored locally and are encrypted. The plugin will try to\nclear decrypted accounts from memory as soon as possible, too.\n\n<!-- lint disable no-emphasis-as-heading -->\n**I am not a security expert, and I am not liable for any problems that may\narise due to using this plugin.**\n<!-- lint enable no-emphasis-as-heading -->\n\n![alt demo](http://i.giphy.com/l3fQndLP7SVAIXgWc.gif)\n\n### How to use\n\n1.  Either click the `Plugins > Lastpass` menu item or use `Cmd or Ctrl + L`.\n2.  Enter your Lastpass username and password.\n3.  If you need to enter a 2 factor authentication pin, enter it.\n4.  Search for the password you want to enter.\n5.  Click on the row you would like to autofill a password with.\n6.  ????\n7.  PROFIT!!!\n\n### Caveats\n\nThere's currently no way of updating your Lastpass vault locally. The vaults are\nstored to `~/.lastpass-vault-${USERNAME}`, delete the vault you'd like to update\nand re-login to update the vault.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/sibartlett/hyperterm-1password\n[2]: https://github.com/dfrankland/lastpass-node\n"
